## [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

This was quite a bit easier than last year's usual starting problem, but
a tad more than previous years.  The two parts are specified elementwise,
but have neat implementations using bulk operations on lists and maps
respectively.

## [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

This was simple list manipulation.  The second part looks more
complicated, but yields to a simple exhaustive search.

## [Day 3: Mull It Over](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)

This was a job for regular expressions, with the second part also needing
a little list manipulation.

## [Day 4: Ceres Search](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)

I initially treated this as a list manipulation, which was adequate for
the first part, but not for the twist in the second.  Both parts are
easily done using positions  in a grid.
