## [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

This was a bit more work than the usual starting problem.  The second part
gives a taste of our initial solution working for the test input but not
the real input.  The test input does at least suggest (on every second
line) the question we should be asking, but it also contains a red herring.

## [Day 2: Cube Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

The main work here is parsing the input.  After that, the first part is
a simple computation and the second part is the inverse.

## [Day 3: Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

The main effort here is a bit of 2-dimensional parsing, but the rest is
straightforward if you follow the definitions precisely.

## [Day 4: Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

The parsing is much the same as day 2.  The first part is simple, but
gets us thinking about powers, and in the second part we clearly need
to change the representation to avoid exponential blowup, but it comes
out neatly.
