## [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)

This was an easy exercise with list functions, especially `zip`.
I did the second part as a direct implementation of the description,
but a little analysis yields a more efficient solution.

## [Day 2: Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)

This was an exercise in applying a list of commands to a state, as seen
in early puzzles in previous years.

## [Day 3: Binary Diagnostic](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)

The description (particularly the second part) is lengthy, but the first
part is a neat list manipulation, while the second requires recursion.
In each part, using two separate traversals is much easier than trying
to do both at once.  Both parts rely on unstated properties of the input.
