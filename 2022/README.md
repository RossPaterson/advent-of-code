## [Day 1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

This was an easy exercise with list functions, directly implementing
the description.

## [Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)

This involves simple functions on values.  It shouldn't have been
difficult, but I got in a tangle mixing up the four 3-value types that
were involved.

## [Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)

An easy exercise using lists and sets.
