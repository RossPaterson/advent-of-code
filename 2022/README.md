## [Day 1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

This was an easy exercise with list functions, directly implementing
the description.

## [Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)

This involves simple functions on values.  It shouldn't have been
difficult, but I got in a tangle mixing up the four 3-value types that
were involved.

## [Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)

An easy exercise using lists and sets.

## [Day 4: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4)

This one involves a little parsing, and then basic range operations,
with a neat symmetry between the parts.

## [Day 5: Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5)

After messy input parsing, the main computation is list processing,
which works out neatly using list functions.  The second part is slightly
simpler than the first.

## [Day 6: Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6)

In this small puzzle, the temptation is to engineer an efficient solution,
but for this input a simplistic approach runs quickly enough, even with
the increased window size of the second part.  Working out a version that
is linear in the window size is a nice exercise, but complete overkill
for this problem size.
